In TunnelMan, the player has to dig underground tunnels through an oil field looking for oil. After the player has gathered all available oil within a particular field, the level is completed and the player advances to a new, more difficult oil field. Unfortunately, the TunnelMan is not alone. A band of Regular and Hardcore Protesters roam around the oil field and shout at the TunnelMan any time they get near to him.
